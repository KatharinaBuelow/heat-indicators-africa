# Region

The country shape files will be read by [climate fact data](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/gerics_infrastructure/climate_fact_data).

Here are some Notebooks to explore the original shape file and make a big region, for example here I combined all WASCAL staes to one region.

The shape file should be put into this directory:

    ~/climate_fact_data/climate_fact_data/data/shp
